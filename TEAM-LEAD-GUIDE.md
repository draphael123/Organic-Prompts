# Guide for Team Leads

## Overview

This workspace is designed to help team members use Cursor's AI as a **thinking partner** for mini-workshop assignments, not as a way to bypass the learning process.

## How It Works

Team members use structured prompts that guide AI to:
- Ask questions rather than provide answers
- Help explore concepts without writing responses
- Scaffold thinking without completing work
- Challenge ideas and push deeper thinking

## Setting Up Your Team

### 1. Share the Workspace

- Share this folder with team members
- Or have them clone/copy the structure
- Everyone should work in this workspace when using Cursor for workshops

### 2. Onboard New Members

Point new team members to:
- `QUICK-START.md` - 5-minute intro
- `guides/how-to-use-cursor-for-workshops.md` - Detailed walkthrough
- `examples/tiktok-algorithm-example.md` - Concrete example

### 3. Explain the Philosophy

Make it clear:
- ✅ AI helps you think through concepts
- ✅ AI asks questions to deepen understanding
- ✅ AI helps structure your ideas
- ❌ AI does NOT write your responses
- ❌ AI does NOT complete assignments for you

### 4. Set Expectations

- Responses should be in team members' own words
- They should demonstrate understanding of concepts
- Original thinking is expected
- AI is a tool, not a replacement for learning

## The .cursorrules File

The `.cursorrules` file configures Cursor to act as a thinking partner. It instructs AI to:
- Ask questions instead of giving answers
- Scaffold thinking without completing work
- Challenge ideas and push deeper understanding

This file ensures consistent behavior across your team.

## Recognizing Good vs. Problematic Usage

### ✅ Good Usage

Team members who:
- Ask for help understanding concepts
- Use AI to explore ideas and ask questions
- Write their responses in their own words
- Reference their conversation with AI but produce original work
- Show clear understanding of concepts in their response

### ❌ Problematic Usage

Red flags:
- Responses that sound AI-generated (generic, overly polished)
- Copy-pasted content from AI conversations
- Lack of personal insight or specific details
- Responses that don't match the team member's usual writing style
- Missing understanding of concepts they claim to reference

## Addressing Issues

If you notice problematic usage:

1. **Have a conversation** - Ask about their process
2. **Clarify expectations** - Remind them of the philosophy
3. **Review the guides** - Direct them back to examples
4. **Check their understanding** - Ask them to explain concepts in their own words
5. **Adjust if needed** - Some team members may need more guidance

## Customizing for Your Team

Feel free to:
- Modify prompt templates to match your team's style
- Add company-specific context or frameworks
- Create templates for recurring workshop types
- Add examples from your actual workshops
- Update `.cursorrules` to match your preferences

## Monitoring Effectiveness

Good signs that the system is working:
- Team members understand concepts better
- Responses show original thinking
- Ideas are specific and well-reasoned
- Team members can explain their ideas clearly
- Learning happens, not just completion

## Tips for Workshop Design

When creating mini-workshops that work well with this system:
1. Ask for specific, measurable experiments/ideas
2. Require explanation of concepts being applied
3. Ask for desired outcomes/results
4. Make it clear that original thinking is expected
5. Consider having team members share their process briefly

## Questions?

If team members are unsure about boundaries:
- Encourage them to ask questions
- Remind them: "If you're actively thinking and writing, you're doing it right"
- Use the examples as references
- Have conversations about what good use looks like
