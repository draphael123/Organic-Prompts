# Add-On Promotion Strategy Framework

Use this framework to structure your thinking about promoting add-ons through organic content.

## Key Questions to Answer First

Before building your plan, you need to understand:

### 1. Current State Assessment
- What add-ons are currently being promoted (if any)?
- How are they currently being promoted?
- What's the current conversion rate for add-ons vs. main products?
- What content formats are you using (posts, videos, stories, etc.)?
- What's your team's comfort level with promoting prescription medications?

### 2. Compliance & Regulations
- What are the legal/regulatory requirements for promoting prescription medications?
- What disclaimers or disclosures are required?
- Are there platform-specific rules (TikTok, Instagram, etc.) for medical content?
- Do you have a compliance review process?
- What happens if content violates regulations?

### 3. Audience & Messaging
- Who is your target audience for add-ons?
- What language/messaging resonates with them?
- What concerns or objections might they have?
- How do you balance education vs. promotion?
- What's the appropriate tone for sensitive medical topics?

### 4. Content Strategy
- How do add-ons naturally fit into your content?
- What content formats work best for your audience?
- How often should add-ons be mentioned?
- Should it be subtle integration or explicit promotion?
- What's your content approval process?

### 5. Goals & Success Metrics
- What are you trying to achieve? (awareness, conversions, revenue)
- How will you measure success?
- What's a realistic target?
- What's your baseline to compare against?
- How will you track performance?

## Planning Framework

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Questions to answer:**

**Actions:**
- [ ] Review compliance requirements
- [ ] Assess current content performance
- [ ] Identify team concerns/questions
- [ ] Define success metrics
- [ ] Create content guidelines

### Phase 2: Pilot/Testing (Week 3-4)
**Questions to answer:**
- What's the smallest test we can run to learn quickly?
- Which content creator(s) should test this first?
- What's a safe, low-risk way to start?
- How will we gather feedback?

**Actions:**
- [ ] Select pilot content creators
- [ ] Create test content pieces
- [ ] Set up tracking/measurement
- [ ] Run initial tests
- [ ] Gather data and feedback

### Phase 3: Refinement (Week 5-6)
**Questions to answer:**
- What did we learn from the pilot?
- What worked? What didn't?
- What adjustments need to be made?
- How do we scale what works?

**Actions:**
- [ ] Analyze pilot results
- [ ] Refine approach based on learnings
- [ ] Update guidelines/templates
- [ ] Plan broader rollout

### Phase 4: Scale (Week 7+)
**Questions to answer:**
- How do we roll this out to the full team?
- What training or resources are needed?
- How do we maintain quality and compliance?
- How do we continue to optimize?

**Actions:**
- [ ] Team training/kickoff
- [ ] Provide templates/resources
- [ ] Ongoing support and feedback
- [ ] Regular performance reviews

## Content Integration Ideas to Explore

Think about these approaches (but decide what fits your team):

### Educational Approach
- "Did you know about X?" content
- Educational series about add-ons
- Answering common questions
- Comparing options

### Testimonial/Story Approach
- User stories (with permission)
- Results-focused content
- Before/after narratives
- Community-driven content

### Seamless Integration
- Natural mentions in relevant content
- Link in bio additions
- End-of-video callouts
- Value-add positioning

### Value-Based Approach
- Focus on benefits, not features
- Address concerns proactively
- Build trust first
- Position as enhancement, not requirement

## Risk Mitigation Considerations

- Compliance violations
- Team pushback or discomfort
- Audience negative reactions
- Platform restrictions
- Overselling or appearing too promotional
- Legal issues with medical claims

## Questions to Discuss with Your Team

1. What are your team's main concerns about promoting add-ons?
2. What would make you feel more comfortable with this?
3. What training or resources would help?
4. How do you want to be measured/evaluated on this?
5. What support do you need from leadership?

## Next Steps to Get Started

1. **Gather Information**: Answer the "Key Questions" above
2. **Identify Stakeholders**: Who needs to be involved? (compliance, legal, team, leadership)
3. **Create a Working Document**: Start documenting your answers and thinking
4. **Schedule Planning Meeting**: Get the team together to discuss
5. **Design Small Test**: Plan a low-risk pilot
