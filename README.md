## Philosophy

**The goal is to scaffold thinking, not complete the work.**

Cursor's AI can help team members:
- Break down complex assignments into manageable steps
- Identify key concepts from videos/articles
- Structure their thinking and organize ideas
- Brainstorm and explore possibilities
- Get unstuck when they hit a wall

Cursor's AI should NOT:
- Write the entire response for them
- Generate the final polished answer
- Replace their own analysis and creativity

## How to Use This System

1. **When you receive a mini-workshop assignment:**
   - Open Cursor in this workspace
   - Use the appropriate prompt template for brainstorming
