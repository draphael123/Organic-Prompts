# Quick Start Guide

## For Team Members New to Using Cursor for Workshops

### The 5-Minute Version

1. **Watch/Read the workshop material first** - Take your own notes
2. **Open Cursor** in this workspace
3. **Copy a prompt** from `prompt-templates/video-analysis-workshop.md`
4. **Fill in your details** - What video did you watch? What did you learn?
5. **Have a conversation** - Let AI help you think through concepts
6. **Write your response yourself** - Use your own words, not AI's

### Remember

🤔 **AI helps you think**  
✍️ **You write the response**

### Common First-Time Questions

**Q: Can I just ask AI to write my workshop response?**  
A: No - that defeats the purpose. The goal is learning and developing your own ideas, not getting AI to do the work.

**Q: How do I know if I'm using AI correctly?**  
A: If you're actively thinking and writing in your own words, you're on the right track. If you're copy-pasting AI output, you're not.

**Q: What if I don't understand something from the video?**  
A: Perfect! Ask AI to explain the concept or ask clarifying questions. That's exactly what it's for.

**Q: Can AI help me brainstorm?**  
A: Yes! Brainstorming, exploring concepts, and structuring your thinking are great uses.
