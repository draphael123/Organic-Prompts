            <h2>📹 TikTok Algorithm Workshop Example</h2>
            <p>This example shows a complete conversation flow for a mini-workshop assignment about the TikTok algorithm.</p>

            <h3>Step 1: Initial Brainstorming</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <pre><strong>You:</strong>
I'm working on a mini-workshop assignment. I need to watch a video about the TikTok algorithm and come up with one idea or experiment to try based on the concepts discussed.

Can you help me:
1. Identify the key concepts/frameworks mentioned in the video (I'll share what I learned)
2. Brainstorm potential areas where these concepts could apply to our work
3. Ask me questions that help me think deeper about how to apply these concepts

Please DON'T write my final response - just help me explore and structure my thinking.

Here's what I understand so far from the video:
- The algorithm values engagement patterns in the first few seconds
- There's something about "hook patterns" that keep viewers watching
- The creator mentioned testing different opening styles
- Early engagement signals are really important
- Comments and shares matter more than just likes</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>AI (should respond with):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Questions about your current content</li>
                <li>Suggestions for concepts to explore deeper</li>
                <li>Guidance on which concepts might be most applicable</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Deep Dive on a Concept</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <pre><strong>You:</strong>
I'm focusing on the concept of "hook patterns" from the video. The creator talked about how the first 3 seconds determine if someone keeps watching.

Can you:
1. Help me understand different ways hook patterns could be applied
2. Ask me probing questions about our current content strategy
3. Help me think about what success would look like if we tested this concept
4. Challenge my thinking with "what if" scenarios</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>AI (should ask questions like):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>"What's your current opening strategy? Do you have a consistent pattern?"</li>
                <li>"What types of content do you create? How might hook patterns differ for different content types?"</li>
                <li>"Have you noticed any patterns in which of your current videos perform best in the first few seconds?"</li>
                <li>"What's one area where you think your hooks might be weak?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Experiment Design</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <pre><strong>You:</strong>
Based on our conversation, I'm thinking about testing different hook patterns - specifically opening with a question vs. opening with a bold statement vs. opening with a visual surprise.

Can you help me:
1. Break down what elements make this experiment testable and measurable?
2. Help me identify what variables we'd need to track
3. Ask me questions about our baseline/current state
4. Help me think about potential obstacles</pre>
            </div>

            <p><strong>AI (should help you think through):</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Metrics to track (first 3-second retention, overall watch time, completion rate)</li>
                <li>Sample size considerations</li>
                <li>Variables to control</li>
                <li>Questions about your current baseline</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Writing Your Own Response</h3>
            <p><strong>Now YOU write your final response (not the AI):</strong></p>
            
            <div style="background: #f0f9ff; padding: 1.5rem; border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-color); border-radius: 4px; margin: 1rem 0;">
                <p><strong>Example Response (written by you):</strong></p>
                <p>I want to experiment with testing different hook patterns in the first 3 seconds of our videos.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The concept from the video:</strong> The algorithm heavily weights early engagement signals - specifically whether viewers stay past the first few seconds. The creator emphasized that the hook pattern you use determines whether someone keeps watching or scrolls away.</p>
                
                <p><strong>My experiment:</strong> I'd like to A/B test three different hook patterns over the next 2 weeks:
                <ol>
                    <li>Question-based hooks ("Have you ever wondered why...")</li>
                    <li>Bold statement hooks ("Most people get this wrong...")</li>
                    <li>Visual surprise hooks (unexpected visual element in first frame)</li>
                </ol>
                
                For each video, I'll track:
                <ul>
                    <li>First 3-second retention rate</li>
                    <li>Average watch time</li>
                    <li>Completion rate</li>
                </ul>
                
                <strong>Desired result:</strong> Identify which hook pattern drives the best early engagement, with a goal of increasing our first 3-second retention by at least 15% on average. This should improve our overall video performance since the algorithm favors content that keeps viewers watching early.</p>

            <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
            <p>Notice how:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>✅ The AI asked questions that guided your analysis</li>
                <li>✅ YOU wrote the final response in your own words</li>
                <li>✅ The response clearly explains the concept and desired result</li>
                <li>✅ It's specific, measurable, and testable</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>This is the balance we're aiming for - AI as a thinking partner, not a replacement for your own work.</strong></p>
