# How to Deploy Your Website

## Quick Options

### 1. Just View It Locally (Easiest)

**Windows:**
- Right-click `index.html`
- Select "Open with" → Choose your browser

**Mac:**
- Double-click `index.html` - it should open in your default browser

### 2. Share via Cloud Storage

- Upload the entire `website` folder to:
  - Google Drive (share link)
  - Dropbox (share link)
  - OneDrive (share link)
- Share the link to `index.html` with your team

### 3. Free Hosting Options

#### Netlify (Recommended - Easiest)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Sign up for free account
3. Drag and drop the `website` folder
4. Get instant URL (like `your-team.netlify.app`)
5. Share URL with your team

#### Vercel

2. Upload the `website` folder contents
3. Go to Settings → Pages

### 4. Internal Server/Intranet

If you have internal hosting:
- Upload files to your web server
- Access via internal URL (e.g., `team-resources.company.com`)

## Which Option to Choose?

- **Just viewing yourself?** → Option 1 (local file)
- **Sharing with small team?** → Option 2 (cloud storage)
- **Want a permanent URL?** → Option 3 (free hosting - Netlify is easiest)
- **Have IT infrastructure?** → Option 4 (internal server)

## Tips

- ✅ Test locally first before deploying

- ✅ Make sure copy-to-clipboard works (requires HTTPS)
- ✅ Bookmark the URL for easy access
- ✅ Update content by editing HTML files and re-uploading
