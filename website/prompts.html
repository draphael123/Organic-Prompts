            <h2>📹 Video Analysis Workshop Prompts</h2>
            <p>Use these when your mini-workshop involves watching a video and developing ideas based on it.</p>

            <h3>Initial Brainstorming Prompt</h3>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">Copy</button>
                <pre>I'm working on a mini-workshop assignment. I need to watch [VIDEO TOPIC/TITLE] and come up with one idea or experiment to try based on the concepts discussed.

Can you help me:
1. Identify the key concepts/frameworks mentioned in the video (I'll share what I learned)
2. Brainstorm potential areas where these concepts could apply to our work
3. Ask me questions that help me think deeper about how to apply these concepts

Please DON'T write my final response - just help me explore and structure my thinking. I want to develop my own idea.

Here's what I understand so far from the video:
[PASTE YOUR INITIAL NOTES/UNDERSTANDING]</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Deep Dive Prompt</h3>
            <p>After you've identified a concept you want to explore:</p>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">Copy</button>
                <pre>I'm focusing on the concept of [CONCEPT NAME] from the video. 

Can you:
1. Help me understand different ways this concept could be applied
2. Ask me probing questions about our current content strategy/processes
3. Help me think about what success would look like if we tested this concept
4. Challenge my thinking with "what if" scenarios

Again, I'm looking for exploration and structure, not a ready-made answer. Help me think through this myself.</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Experiment Design Prompt</h3>
            <p>When you have a concept and want to turn it into a testable experiment:</p>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">Copy</button>
                <pre>I want to experiment with [CONCEPT/METHOD]. 

Can you help me:
1. Break down what elements make an experiment testable and measurable?
2. Help me identify what variables we'd need to track
3. Ask me questions about our baseline/current state
4. Help me think about potential obstacles or considerations

Help me structure my thinking about the experiment design, but let me define the specific details myself.</pre>
            </div>

            <h3>Final Check Prompt</h3>
            <p>Before submitting, use this to refine your thinking:</p>
            <div class="prompt-box">
                <button class="copy-btn" onclick="copyPrompt(this)">Copy</button>
                <pre>I'm preparing my workshop response. Here's my draft idea:

[YOUR IDEA DRAFT]

Can you:
1. Ask me questions to ensure I've clearly explained the concept I'm referring to
2. Help me think about whether my desired result is specific and measurable
3. Point out any gaps in my explanation that might need clarification

Please focus on asking questions rather than rewriting my response.</pre>
