## Tips for Effective Prompts

1. **Be specific about what you want:** "Help me think through X" not "Do X for me"
2. **Provide context:** Share what you've already learned or thought about
3. **Set boundaries:** Explicitly state what you DON'T want (e.g., "Don't write my response")
4. **Ask for questions:** Encourage the AI to ask probing questions rather than give answers
5. **Iterate:** Use multiple prompts in sequence to go deeper
