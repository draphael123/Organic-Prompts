# Pre-Submission Checklist

Use this checklist before submitting your workshop response to ensure you've used AI appropriately.

## ✅ Before You Submit

- [ ] I watched/read the workshop material myself and took my own notes
- [ ] I used AI to help me think, explore concepts, or ask questions
- [ ] I wrote my final response in my own words (not copied from AI)
- [ ] My response clearly explains the concept I'm referencing
- [ ] My response includes specific details relevant to our work
- [ ] My response demonstrates my own understanding and thinking
- [ ] I can explain my idea if asked about it
- [ ] The writing style sounds like me, not like AI

## 🎯 Quality Checks

- [ ] **Concept Clarity**: Can someone else understand what concept I'm referring to?
- [ ] **Specificity**: Is my idea/experiment specific enough to actually test?
- [ ] **Measurability**: Have I explained what result I'm hoping to achieve?
- [ ] **Originality**: Does this reflect my own thinking, not just AI suggestions?

## ⚠️ Red Flags (If you check these, reconsider your approach)

- [ ] I copy-pasted directly from an AI conversation
- [ ] I asked AI to write my response for me
- [ ] I didn't watch/read the material myself
- [ ] My response doesn't include any personal insights or details
- [ ] I can't explain my idea beyond what I wrote

## 🎓 Learning Check

Before submitting, ask yourself:
- Do I understand the concept I'm referencing?
- Can I explain why this experiment makes sense?
- Do I know what I'd actually do to test this?
- Am I excited about this idea, or did I just pick something AI suggested?

If you answered "yes" to these questions, you're on the right track!

---

**Remember**: The goal is learning and developing your own ideas. If you're not sure whether you've used AI appropriately, it's always better to ask for clarification than to submit something that doesn't represent your own thinking.
