# How to Use Cursor for Mini-Workshops

A step-by-step guide for team members who are new to using AI assistance for workshop assignments.

## Step 1: Watch and Take Initial Notes

Before using Cursor:
1. Watch the video/read the material
2. Take basic notes on what stands out to you
3. Note any concepts that seem relevant to your work
4. Write down questions or things you don't understand

**Don't skip this step!** You need your own initial understanding to have a productive conversation with AI.

## Step 2: Use the Initial Brainstorming Prompt

1. Open Cursor in this workspace
2. Go to `prompt-templates/video-analysis-workshop.md`
3. Copy the "Initial Brainstorming Prompt"
4. Fill in the video details and paste your initial notes
5. Paste the prompt into Cursor's chat

The AI will help you identify key concepts and brainstorm application areas.

## Step 3: Explore Specific Concepts

As the AI helps you explore, you'll likely find one or two concepts that interest you. When you've chosen one:

1. Use the "Deep Dive Prompt" from the template
2. Have a conversation where the AI asks you questions
3. Think through your answers - this is where your insights develop

## Step 4: Design Your Experiment

Once you have a concept you want to test:

1. Use the "Experiment Design Prompt"
2. Let the AI help you think through:
   - What makes it testable
   - What you'd measure
   - What your baseline is
   - Potential challenges

## Step 5: Write Your Response (In Your Own Words)

This is the crucial step:
- **Don't copy the AI's output**
- Use your conversation with the AI to write your own response
- The AI helped you think; now you articulate your thinking
- Your voice, your analysis, your idea

## Step 6: Final Check (Optional)

Use the "Final Check Prompt" to ensure you've explained everything clearly. But again, the AI should ask questions, not rewrite your work.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Don't:** Ask the AI to write your workshop response
✅ **Do:** Ask the AI to help you think through concepts

❌ **Don't:** Copy-paste AI output as your final answer
✅ **Do:** Use AI insights to write in your own words

❌ **Don't:** Skip doing your own initial analysis
✅ **Do:** Watch the video and take notes first

❌ **Don't:** Use AI to avoid thinking
✅ **Do:** Use AI to think deeper and more structured

## Example Workflow

1. Watch TikTok algorithm video → Take notes on 3-4 key points
2. Use brainstorming prompt → AI helps identify "hook patterns" as a concept
3. Deep dive on hook patterns → AI asks: "What's your current hook strategy? What's working?"
4. Design experiment → AI helps you think: "How would you measure if different hooks work better?"
5. Write response → YOU write: "I want to experiment with [your specific idea] because [your reasoning]..."
6. Submit your own work!

## When to Ask for Help

If you're stuck at any step:
- Ask specific questions: "I don't understand how to measure X"
- Ask for examples: "Can you give me an example of what a good experiment design looks like?"
- Ask for clarification: "Can you explain concept Y in simpler terms?"

The key is being an active participant in the conversation, not a passive recipient of answers.
